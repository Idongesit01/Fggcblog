        <h2>3rd Annual General Meeting</h2>
        <p class="paragraph" >The Federal Government Girls College (FGGC) IOI Alumnae Association held its third Annual General Meeting on the 27th of August, 2022. 
            This was a much-anticipated event as the previous three AGMs had been cancelled due to Covid-related travel restrictions.
            The AGM was held in four different physical chapter meets, and an online broadcast of the annual report was also made available to members who could not attend the physical meetings. 
            This report highlights the event as it unfolded in different chapters of the association. <br> 
        </p>
        <p><strong> Physical Chapter:<br></strong>  Meets In consideration of the Covid-19 pandemic and general security considerations in the country, the decision was made to hold this year's AGM in a hybrid format.
            Four different physical chapter meets were organized in Lagos, Uyo, Calabar, and Port-Harcourt. This chapter meets provided an opportunity for members to meet in person and discuss important issues affecting the association. 
            Members who attended the physical meetings were excited to meet old friends and reminisce about their days at FGGC IOI.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Online Broadcast:<br></strong>  The online broadcast of the annual report was made available to members who could not attend the physical meetings. This was a great idea as it allowed members who were unable to travel to participate
            in the AGM from the comfort of their homes.
            The online broadcast also ensured that members who were not able to attend the physical meetings were still able to contribute to the discussions and vote on important matters.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>President's Speech: <br></strong> The President's speech was the highlight of the AGM. The President, in her speech, thanked all members for their unwavering support towards the association. 
            She also spoke about the challenges that the association had faced over the past year, particularly the Covid-19 pandemic, and the efforts that had been made to overcome them. 
            The President highlighted some of the association's achievements over the past year, including the completion of a project to renovate the school's library and the donation of textbooks to the school.
